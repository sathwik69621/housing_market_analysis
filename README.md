# 🏠 Visualizing Housing Market Trends Using Tableau

This project analyzes housing market trends using data visualization in Tableau, focusing on factors such as renovation recency, house age, and structural features like the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and floors. By transforming raw housing data into interactive dashboards, it helps reveal hidden patterns that inform strategic pricing and renovation decisions for **ABC Company**.

## 📊 **Project Overview**
- **Dataset:** `Transformed_Housing_Data2.csv`
- **Visualizations:** Built in Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public
- **Main Objectives:**
  - Visualize overall data metrics and KPIs
  - Analyze total sales by years since renovation
  - Explore age distribution of renovated vs. non-renovated houses
  - Examine house age distribution across features (bathrooms, bedrooms, floors)

## 📝 **Usage**
1. **Open the dataset** in Tableau.
2. Create calculated fields:
   - `House Age` = 2025 - Year Built
   - `Years Since Renovation` = 2025 - Year Renovated (handle zeros)
3. Build dashboards as per the scenarios:
   - KPI overview
   - Total sales by years since renovation
   - Pie chart for renovation status vs. house age
   - Grouped bar chart for house age vs. number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and floors
4. Export dashboards to images or PDF if needed.
